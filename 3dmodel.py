    #Hmm ok so what did scott say about the use of the api
    #like did he say reference it and create something similar?
    #Ohh that makes sense. Gotcha gotcha, so we just need to create a class that will call
    #the API and then use that model 
    
    #I think when I asked about it he told us that we should have like a base mesh
    #basically I think he meant that we make a basic mesh from this api and
    #then add the details later on using tommy's depth and tejas stuff you know
